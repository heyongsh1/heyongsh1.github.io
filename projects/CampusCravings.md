**Campus Craving**

**Overview**

Throughout the development of our campus vendor food app, I gained valuable insights into the process of software engineering, from ideation and design to collaboration and implementation. Our goal was to create a platform where students could easily browse food options available on campus, view daily specials, and make informed choices based on availability, price, and dietary needs.
